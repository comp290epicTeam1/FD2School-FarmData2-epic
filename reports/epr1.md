1. Achievements and activities

	Task divisions: Ha will be working on the first two tests (page header of "Seeding Input Log" and section with the label "Comments"), James will be working on the next two tests (comments section with empty text area and page containing “Generate Report“ button) and Tai will be working on the last test (disabled “Generate Report” button).

2. Planned activities for the next week

- Tai: I will try to complete the rest of my overdue FarmData schoolwork by Friday and my part of this activity by the end of the week.
    
- Ha: I have started on the first task. I am still finishing up with the homework.
    
- James: I'm heading to the first task: testing the comment box of the Seeding Input.
    

3. Challenges and difficulties

- Tai: I have had some difficulties catching on with my overdue FarmData Schoolwork, which includes the Testing section needed for this activity so I think it’s best to begin working on this activity only after I am finished with the last assignment. I am close and project it to be completed by Friday. I apologize for my delayed progress and I am trying my best to complete my part of this activity by the end of this week.  
- Ha: I am starting the project using the laptop in the classroom.
- James: Currently, I do not face any challenge.
