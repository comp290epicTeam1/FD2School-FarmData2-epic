3. Challenges and difficulties
  - Tai: For the second issue, I initially had some issues with locating the elements in Cypress as we are not supposed to use data-cy as we did on the first issue. I went through the document linked to the issue and was able to find the way to call a class in Cypress. I wrote and ran the tests for my part successfully after that. 
  - James: As I’m working on the new issue, I’m still finding out why although all the test past, but when other account is login to the test to check the tabs, the test still passed, which should be fail instead.
  - Ha: (in progress)
